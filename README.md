# Hyperledger Fabric in the Pharmaceutical industry

# Project Description

Simple use case to demonstrate supply-chain management in the pharmaceutical industry using HyperLedger Fabric blockchain and HTML webpage. 
The application included functions of "Query All Drug On chain", "Query a Specific Drug ID", "Create Drug Movement Record", and "Change Drug product Current Holder".
Our application will allow users to track the specific drug moving from Drug Manufacturer to pharmacy. Between the Manufacturer and Pharmacy stages, we will track the drug
status when the Wholesaler, packager, or distributor holds the specific drug. Currently, drugs are difficult to track during transportation which leads to counterfeit drugs
and companies face problems with regulatory compliance because we can't exactly confirm the source of the drug without stamps confirming the time of packaging and  location.
